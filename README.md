# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game developed using Python. The game allows you to control a snake and navigate it around the screen to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body while trying to eat as much food as possible.
The snake can be controlled by the arrow keys in the keyboard.
